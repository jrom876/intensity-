LED Array Circuit Modeling Tool

This tool allows us to calculate and display a broad range of light intensities and thermal limits for LED array driver circuits by mathematically modeling circuit performance.

It includes Check unit tests with iterators and assertions to find edge cases.

This code can easily be modified to model Electronic circuit performance in general.
