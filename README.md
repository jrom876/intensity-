LED Array Circuit Modeling Tool

This tool allows us to calculate and display a broad range of LED array driver circuit parameters by mathematically modeling circuit performance.

We can model all aspects of any LED driver circuit: input power, light intensities, resistor values, branch and total currents, power dissipation, thermal variations, etc...

It includes Check unit tests with iterators and assertions to find edge cases.

This code can easily be modified to model Electronic circuit performance in general.
