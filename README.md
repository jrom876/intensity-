LED Array Circuit Analysis Tool

This tool allows us to calculate and display a broad range of intensities and thermal limits for LED arrays by modeling circuit performance.
It includes Check unit tests with iterators and assertions to find edge cases.

This code can also be modified to model Electronic circuit performance in general.
